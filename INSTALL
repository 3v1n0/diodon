Build Diodon 
=======================

Diodon uses the WAF build system. To build and install Diodon use these commands:

    ./waf configure
    ./waf build
    sudo ./waf install

The unity scope needs to be explicitly enabled during configure if desired

    ./waf configure --enable-unityscope

On distributions which do not provide packages for application-indicator
building of the indicator can be disabled with following command:

    ./waf configure --disable-indicator-plugin

For uninstalling type this:

    sudo ./waf uninstall

For developers who also want to run integration tests the following
command build can be run:

    ./waf build --testcmd='%s --integration'
